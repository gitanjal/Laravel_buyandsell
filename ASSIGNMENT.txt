Task 1: We shall load the form to post an ad for a product on clicking the 'sell' button,
          Or on entering the url www.bns.go/sell on the browser's addressbar.
          But currently it is getting loaded as the home page!
          Fix this by passing the correct URI to the first parameter of the function below?
          [##File: /routes/web.php (Line no- 35)]
Task 2: Our form is not secure now, add the csrf directive to make it secure.
        [##File: /resources/views/sell.blade.php (Line no- 10)]
